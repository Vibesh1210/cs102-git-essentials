Summary of CS102 :-
In CS102 we started with basic command of linux. For this a window user has to setup with WSL so that the can have access
to linux enviroment along with windows enviroment . 
Some basic command include :-

1. pwd -> present working directory 
2. ls -> list of all the file and folder in a folder excluding the hidden ones
3. cd -> change the directory 
4. mkdir -> make directory 
5. cat -> one way to see the contain of a text file and also to create a text file

and many more command 

After the basic command we learned archiving a file , making zip files and then Bash scripting followed by 
loops ( for and while loops) . 
And then we learned how to connect to a server placed remotely . For this we have connected to the Mancurad server of
IIT Goa . 
And then we learned what is Git and GitHub. Then we learned how to make repositary on Github , cloning it to local machine
make changes , add changes to staging area and commit your changes and pushing it on your Github. 
Then we learned how to make changes on Github and pull it in your local machine
